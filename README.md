# Rosetta Stone
This repository is a collection of all of the programming practice problems I've encountered. As I see more, I'll add them (or variations of them) and add solutions in as many languages as I can.

## Languages
For now, the two languages globally supported are Python3 and Java. C is the next language I intend to add support for.

## Organization
This repository is separated into three sections, each measured by their difficulty (determined by me). Each section contains subdirectories for each practice problem, and each practice problem subdirectory will contain one document for each language the problem has been solved in, and an explanation document explaining how to approach the problem / why the solutions provided are optimal over potential other solutions.

Feel free to submit a pull request if you add solutions for problems in languages that aren't yet supported, or if you find a solution more optimal than the one provided here.
