# Problem
You are given a set of integers, and must return the
Power Set of the set you've been provided with.

*NOTE*: The Power Set of a set is defined as the set
containing all possible combinations of the numbers
in the given set, INCLUDING the empty set. In this
instance, the empty set is simply an empty array.

## Input
Input is given in the form of an array of integers.

## Output
Your function should return an array containing one of
every possible combination of the integers from the
input array (AKA the Power Set of the input array).

#### Example 1

Input value: 
`[1,2,3]`

Expected output: 
`[[],[1],[2],[3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]`
