# Problem
You are given an integer and need to decide if it is
prime or not.

*NOTE*: An integer being "prime" means it is only
divisible by 1 and itself. An example array of prime
numbers is as follows;

`[2,3,5,7,11,...]`

A special case to be aware of is that 1 and 0 are NOT
to be treated as prime.

## Input
Input is given in the form of a single integer.

## Output
Your function should return a boolean value representing
whether or not the integer input is even.

#### Example 1

Input value: `1`

Expected output: `false`

#### Example 2

Input value: `14`

Expected output: `false`

#### Example 3

Input value: `19`

Expected output: `true`
