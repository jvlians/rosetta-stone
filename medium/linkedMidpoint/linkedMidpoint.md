# Problem
You are given a Linked List and need to find the
median value of the Linked List. Each node in the
Linked List has an integer value, and a "next" node.
A sample Node class is provided in this directory.

## Input
Input is given in the form of a Node representing the
head of the Linked List.

## Output
Your function should return the integer value
corresponding to the median of the Linked List. If there
are an even number of Nodes in the Linked List, then you
should return the average of the two middle-most Nodes'
values.
