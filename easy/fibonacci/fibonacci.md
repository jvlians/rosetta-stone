# Problem
You need to find the `i`th number in the Fibonacci
Sequence, where `i` is any number in the range `[1,n]`.

*NOTE*: The Fibonacci Sequence is a set of numbers that
is self-referential. That is, each number is determined
by the numbers that occur before it. The first few
numbers of the sequence are listed below;

`[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...]`

Assume the above array representing the Fibonacci
Sequence is one-indexed. Try finding the pattern to the
sequence on your own, then write the program.

## Input
Input is given in the form of a single integer in the
range `[1,n]` representing the index of the desired
value in the Fibonacci Sequence.

## Output
Your function should return the number corresponding to
the number at the index requested in the Fibonacci
Sequence.

#### Example 1

Input value: `1`

Expected output: `1`

#### Example 2

Input value: `2`

Expected output: `1`

#### Example 3

Input value: `8`

Expected output: `21`
